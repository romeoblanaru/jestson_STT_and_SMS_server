                    SIM7600G-H MODEM CRASH REPORT
              Submitted to SIMCOM Technical Support
================================================================================

Date: 2025-10-14
Reporter: Romeo
Hardware: Raspberry Pi with SIM7600G-H modem
Manufacturer: SIMCOM INCORPORATED
Model: SIMCOM_SIM7600G-H
Firmware: SIM7600G_V2.0.2
IMEI: 862636055891897
SIM IMSI: 234159593176535
Carrier: Vodafone UK (234-15)

AT+SIMCOMATI Output: NOT CAPTURED
  Reason: Modem crashes before extended info can be retrieved
  Note: This SIMCOM-specific command would provide detailed version info
        but cannot be executed due to modem instability

================================================================================
PROBLEM SUMMARY
================================================================================

The SIM7600G-H modem crashes within 15-90 seconds after USB connection,
resulting in complete USB enumeration failure (kernel error -71) and
disappearance from USB bus. Physical unplug/replug required to recover.

Kernel Error Messages:
  - "Cannot enable. Maybe the USB cable is bad?"
  - "device not accepting address, error -71"
  - "unable to enumerate USB device"

   Purpose: Get manufacturer, model, firmware, IMEI
   Response: Started responding
   Result: 🔴 I/O ERROR - Modem crashed during response

3b. AT+SIMCOMATI
   Purpose: Get SIMCOM-specific extended version information
   Status: NOT CAPTURED (modem crashes before this can be executed)
   Note: This command should provide detailed modem configuration info

4. AT+CIMI
   Purpose: Get IMSI (SIM card number)
   Status: Not reached (modem crashed)

5. AT+CSQ
   Purpose: Get signal strength
   Status: Not reached (modem crashed)

6. AT+COPS?
   Purpose: Get network carrier
   Status: Not reached (modem crashed)

7. AT+CGDCONT?
   Purpose: Query current APN configuration
   Status: Not reached (modem crashed)

8. AT+CEVOLTE?
   Purpose: Query VoLTE status
   Status: Not reached (modem crashed)

PHASE 3: VOICE BOT INITIALIZATION (via /dev/ttyUSB3)
------------------------------------------------------------
Note: Voice bot starts AFTER modem details query

9. AT
   Purpose: Test connection
   Response: OK
   Result: ✅ Success

10. ATE0
    Purpose: Disable echo
    Response: OK
    Result: ✅ Success

11. AT+CEXTERNTONE=1
    Purpose: Enable external tone
    Response: ERROR
    Result: Expected (not supported on SIM7600)

12. AT+CLVL=5
    Purpose: Set volume level
    Response: OK
    Result: ✅ Success

13. AT+CRSL=5
    Purpose: Set ringer sound level
    Response: ERROR
    Result: Expected (not supported on SIM7600)

14. AT+CLIP=1
    Purpose: Enable caller ID
    Response: OK
    Result: ✅ Success

PHASE 4: INTERNET CONFIGURATION (DISABLED IN LATEST TEST)
------------------------------------------------------------
Note: These commands were SKIPPED in latest test, modem still crashed

15. AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","internet"
    Purpose: Set APN for data connection
    Status: SKIPPED (test to isolate crash cause)

16. AT+CGACT=1,1
    Purpose: Activate PDP context
    Status: SKIPPED (test to isolate crash cause)

================================================================================
TEST RESULTS
================================================================================

TEST #1: Normal Configuration (with internet setup)
------------------------------------------------------------
Timeline:
  - 13:43:05 - Modem detected
  - 13:43:06 - AT+CGDCONT executed - OK
  - 13:43:07 - AT+CGACT=1,1 executed - I/O ERROR
  - 13:43:34 - Modem crashed (USB error -71)
Duration: ~30 seconds
Conclusion: Crash occurs shortly after AT+CGACT=1,1

TEST #2: Internet Configuration Disabled
------------------------------------------------------------
Timeline:
  - 14:57:10 - Modem detected
  - 14:57:16 - I/O error during ATI command
  - 14:57:19 - Internet config SKIPPED
  - 14:57:50 - Voice bot started successfully
  - 14:59:28 - Modem crashed (USB error -71)
Duration: ~90 seconds
Conclusion: Modem crashes WITHOUT internet config (but lasts 3x longer)

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. PRIMARY ISSUE: Hardware/USB Communication Failure
   - Same kernel error -71 occurs with OR without AT+CGACT command
   - USB enumeration fails completely
   - Modem disappears from USB bus
   - Recovery requires physical unplug/replug

2. SECONDARY ISSUE: AT Commands Accelerate Crash
   - With rapid AT commands: crashes in 15-30 seconds
   - Without internet config: crashes in 90 seconds
   - Early I/O error during ATI command (reading modem details)
   
3. ABNORMAL BEHAVIOR: Port Renumbering
   - Expected: ttyUSB0-4
   - Observed: ttyUSB0,1,3,4,5 (ttyUSB2 missing, ttyUSB5 appeared)
   - Suggests USB re-enumeration instability

4. CONSISTENT CRASH PATTERN:
   - Always results in kernel error -71
   - Always requires physical reconnection
   - Occurs under multiple test conditions
   - Timing varies but crash is inevitable

================================================================================
HARDWARE CONFIGURATION
================================================================================

Platform: Raspberry Pi (Linux 6.12.25+rpt-rpi-v8)
Connection: USB Y-cable junction with dual power feeding
  - One branch: USB data connection to Raspberry Pi
  - Second branch: Additional USB power supply to modem
  - Purpose: Provides supplemental power beyond Pi's USB port capacity
Power Supply:
  - Raspberry Pi: Standard power supply
  - Modem: Additional USB power via Y-cable second branch
USB Cable Type: USB Y-cable (data + power junction)
Note: Replacement standard USB cable ordered for testing to isolate cable issues

================================================================================
QUESTIONS FOR SIMCOM TECHNICAL SUPPORT
================================================================================

1. Is kernel error -71 (EPROTO) a known issue with SIM7600G-H?

2. Are there known issues with ATI command causing USB instability?

3. Is there a recommended delay between AT commands to prevent crashes?

5. Are there specific USB power requirements not met by standard Pi supply?

6. Is there a firmware update that addresses USB enumeration stability?

7. Could rapid AT command sequences trigger a modem watchdog or protection?

================================================================================
REQUESTED ASSISTANCE
================================================================================

1. Diagnostic procedure to determine if modem hardware is defective

2. Recommended AT command sequence with appropriate delays

3. USB power requirements and recommendations

4. Any known fixes or workarounds for kernel error -71

5. Confirmation if this is a known issue or indicates defective unit
